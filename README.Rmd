> An educational R package ðŸ“¦ for calculate various respiratory physiology parameters.


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Lightbridge-KS/rslab")
```

## Overview

`{rslab}` is an R package that contain functions for calculate respiratory physiology parameters in the following categories.

-   **ATPS to BTPS converter:** conversion of spirometry lung volume/flows from *ATPS* (Ambient Temperature and Pressure Saturated) to *BTPS* (Body Temperature, Pressure, water vapor Saturated)

-   **Harvard Spirometer and Metabolic Rate & Oxygen Consumption:** 

    - Calculate metabolic rate and oxygen consumption $\dot{V}_{O_2}$ from [Harvard Spirometer](https://www.somatco.com/Recording-Spirometer-50-1833-50-1817.pdf) tracing, height and weight of the subject, and environmental conditions which are temperature and barometric pressure.
    - Simulate data to plot Harvard spirometer tracing from respiratory parameters such as oxygen consumption, tidal volume, respiratory rate, and random variation can also be added to give a more realistic plot.
